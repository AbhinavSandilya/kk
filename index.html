                    <p>Yeah, I agree it was kinda awkward if I look at it back now. But hey, Everything starts from 0. At first, I thought we both will skip the date as I was having an eye infection. but you insisted otherwise.</p>

                    <p>Just not the way how I expected it to be. hehe. I still recall myself getting tensed for your health. but later thought ki, ye marjayegi to or ek ladki ko pataunga. Just Kidding bebes. I am glad now that you are okay. </p>

                    <p>This day is still like a dream to me. This is the day, where I held your hand for the first time. We danced, danced, and danced until I lost the track of time. It felt like an eternity.</p>

                    <br>
                    <p>It was wet (I mean't kiss. obviously). It feels so funny if I think about it now. we were coming nearby, going far, trying everything out. At last, when we kissed, It felt like I could carry the entirity of heavens on my shoulders, I could swim in the deepest of the seas (Ran out of ideas). And yeah, I kissed you first. </p>

                    <br>
                    <p>Even the entire wikipedia isn't sufficient to describe my feelings on that day. So keeping it short. You don't know how fast my heart was beating when I was confessing my feelings. I had to recall it a couple of dozen times in my head before telling it out. I still can't fathom that I'm in an relationship with a girl like you. Like how can a single person be gorgeous, have kindest of hearts, innocent. Just like I wanted you to be. Perfect.  </p>
